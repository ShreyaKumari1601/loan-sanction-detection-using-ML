# loan-sanction-detection-using-ML
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Loan Sanction Detection System that uses Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not.
The idea is to analyze applicant details such as income, employment status, loan amount, credit score, and past repayment history to estimate the likelihood of repayment.
By automating the loan approval process, financial institutions can make faster and more accurate decisions, reduce risks, and improve customer satisfaction.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions face challenges in identifying which applicants are likely to default on loans. Traditional loan approval is manual, time-consuming, and prone to human bias.
The problem is to predict loan sanction decisions using customer features and historical data, so that loan officers can rely on data-driven insights.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Collect and preprocess applicant data (demographics, financial status, credit history).

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and key features.

Apply Machine Learning models to predict loan approval outcomes.

Compare models using accuracy and classification metrics.

Provide an explainable and transparent prediction system.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Description

Features may include:

Applicant Income

Co-applicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit Score

Employment Type

Marital Status

Property Area

Target Variable: Loan Status (Approved = 1, Not Approved = 0)

ðŸ”¹ Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (mean/median imputation).

Encode categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).

Scale numerical variables (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions of features.

Identify correlations between income, loan amount, credit score, and approval status.

Detect outliers and anomalies.

Feature Selection

Use statistical tests and correlation analysis to select important predictors.

Drop irrelevant or highly correlated features.

Model Building

Train multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

Use train-test split or cross-validation for training and evaluation.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Confusion Matrix

Model Deployment (Optional)

Create a Flask or Streamlit web app.

Allow users to input applicant details and get real-time loan sanction predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Expected Outcomes

A machine learning model that can predict loan sanction decisions with high accuracy.

Insights into which features (e.g., credit score, income, debt ratio) are most important.

A simple and interactive application that can be used by loan officers.

ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings

Hands-on practice in data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering.

Understanding of classification algorithms and model evaluation.

Practical experience in building a real-world financial prediction system.

Exposure to responsible AI practices by ensuring fairness and transparency in predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

Frameworks (for deployment): Flask / Streamlit

Version Control: Git & GitHub

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

ðŸ”¹ Business Impact

Faster loan approval decisions â†’ improved customer experience.

Reduced manual work and human bias.

Better risk management and reduced default rates for banks.

A scalable system that can handle thousands of applications in real time.
